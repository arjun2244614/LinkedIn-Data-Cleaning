https://www.linkedin.com/in/allen-staines-058b0792/,,"Having created RollsChoice Adhesive Pen after years of research, while not always being successful, I have refined my formulation. We are located in San Diego. Products are distributed world-wide, including the US and countries with evolving cannabis laws. Product innovation is at the forefront of my business in helping the world. 


   RollsChoice Adhesive Pen is a sanitary solution for sealing consumers favorite cigar wrapping papers, enveloping without unsanitary spit. RollsChoice ingredients are all natural and grown from the Earth. This unique product is legal world-wide and just $1 per unit.


   As the cannabis industry evolves, we look forward to providing new and improved products.


   RollsChoice Adhesive Pen contains no THC or cannabis by-products. Nor does it contain sugars, flavors, parabens or other chemicals. For example, I have been drinking it to demonstrate its safety.  Saliva spreads germs and disease. Many dispensaries send out contaminated pre-rolls for consumers to share -- we do not.

- Development, Infrastructure, Business, and Institutions Planning;
- Situational Intelligence; Stakeholder Management; Conflict Analysis;
- 360 degree Full-Color Systems Thinking and Simplification; and
- Competitive participation in politics.

I am renowned for rapid intellectual acquisition of (any) issue or task area and subsequent development of strategic, context-sensitive approaches for unlocking hitherto unseen and/or untapped potentials therein and have, over time, developed intense understanding of (inter-)sectoral barriers and vested interests within and outside Government while retaining the ability to build and maintain strategic, productive relationships in (inter)national political, development, and finance communities.

I have deep understanding of the Nigerian geo-political landscape (including contests at Senatorial and Gubernatorial levels) as it impacts the country’s social dynamics and the resultant (dis)inclination of the general populace to participate in politics and/or take ownership of government decisions and initiatives, even when individual and collective accruable economic, social, and environmental benefits are obvious. 

I have bowed out of active politics and desire to utilize my experience in strategic roles involving but not limited to engagement with the political landscape and the public sector.

I bring keen understanding of the Nigerian political, institutional, conflict and media-driven agenda dynamics - consistently leveraged, as they accrue, to support, lead, create and implement complex, context-sensitive and catalytic transactions and projects in the Development Sectors constantly while achieving near-perfect Geo-Political and Situational Intelligence conclusions per time.",Nigeria,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQFmR-q2rUUlQw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1592438400&v=beta&t=gquIXea_rPs6kYbPBAd8MlUOmju-NedRoHV6CFZyUms,Kazeem,Sanusi,Kazeem Sanusi,3424,3rd,ACoAAAHjpK8BmYSLfiHE4MtJjgPCCzxdnqrDdYw,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAHjpK8BmYSLfiHE4MtJjgPCCzxdnqrDdYw,name",500,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAHjpK8BmYSLfiHE4MtJjgPCCzxdnqrDdYw%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAHjpK8BmYSLfiHE4MtJjgPCCzxdnqrDdYw%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,,Kazeem Sanusi Group - a start-up in development and aggregation phase,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Kazeem%20Sanusi%20Group%20-%20a%20start-up%20in%20development%20and%20aggregation%20phase,CPRO,"FCT Abuja, Nigeria",ene. de 2016 – actualidad,Frontline Citizens Awareness Foundation,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Frontline%20Citizens%20Awareness%20Foundation,Managing Trustee,"- Promotion of political and public sector enlightenment and positive reforms in Nigerian communities

My name is Hugo, I´m 47 and I've been working in financial area since I graduate in Management - 25 years ago - in a career which has strengthened my skills in financial management, developing my sense to identify and solve issues.

Basic I started from the bottom - as a newly graduated I started in auditing area, in completely distinct business, I might say. For example, one day I could be in a real estate office (or in a hotel company) and, in the other, in a bullfighting industry company.

That helps me a lot, not only I was acquiring significant experience but also setting some useful benchmarks.

And several years later, of intense work, I finally reached the CFO position at the age of 28.

I consider that my main contributions for projects rely on the ability to successfuly adapt myself to different scenarios and, with experience and tenacity, overcome problems.

Office support:  Edit, proofread and finalize contracts, subcontracts, agreements, bids and technical reports for clients, government and regulatory agencies; prepare and finalize correspondence, create and send invoices, make travel arrangements, prepare travel and expense reconciliation, track accounts payable and receivable, and other office projects and duties as needed.

Incorporate businesses into an LLC, C, S Corporation, file name changes, incorporate names in other states, file licenses in various states and register trade names in various states.

Research and file Well Registration Applications on stock tank wells for ranchers and farmers with state regulatory agencies. 

For tax preparation:  collect receipts and create Excel Spreadsheets which correspond to IRS Schedule F for Farmers & Ranchers and Schedule C for engineering firms and small businesses.  

Prior to the time of filing your tax returns, we review all expenses and categories assuring that we have all of the information needed to file your tax returns accurately.  I forward the Excel Spreadsheets & backup to you.  You take the Excel Spreadsheets with a print out of the backup receipts to meet with your accountant.  Your tax returns will be filed quickly and easily.

By entering all of your receipts on weekly or bi-weekly schedule, we assure that every expense is allocated for optimizing your tax credits for your Ranch, Farm, Engineering Firm or Small Business.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/khanyi-tenza-376387120/,,"My name Nokukhanya Tenza. I matriculated in Estcourt year 2011. I am holding a BSc degree majoring in Microbiology and Genetics. Through my BSc degree study, I have learnt a lot about the academia. I have been exposed to various fields that complement the Microbiology and Genetics fields as a qualification such as working with microorganisms, the corresponding skills in using advanced procedural equipment and practical work at companies such as uMngeni Water Board. I also have done some projects in my undergraduate studies and would like to further my career by doing more research.

During the course of my undergraduate, I was actively involved in departmental activities such as show casing my research prowess through presentations to peers. I was an active member of the Black Woman in Science society. We were visiting different universities and high schools encouraging young black woman to study science. Our intention was to foster the emancipation of black woman through education, facilitating a change in the mindset amongst previously disadvantaged woman pursuing careers that they were previously strategically and circumstantially excluded from.I recently completed the Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Genetics, which it will be conferred during 2019.  

I’m a successful and results-oriented person with high energy and positive attitude. I have a strong sense of responsibility and self-motivation and believe that I am great problem solver. I like working in teams but I also have the ability to work independently. I am creative, flexible and efficient.  In summary, I am an ambitious person who is willing to learn.  

I am a looking for an employment opportunity either as Graduate Trainee or Intern or an entry level employee in the laboratory environment. I am looking for a position with both Private and Public Sector.","Pietermaritzburg y alrededores, Sudáfrica",https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHE7OV8XFTt2Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1593043200&v=beta&t=jHSW-3LpMLZJIlQh7OQk9soioJRP9SZVYWrbYq-bmr8,Khanyi,Tenza,Khanyi Tenza,1707,3rd,ACoAAB30nUoBUvPfDvlZUxXvcgIasRAMJZAgL9U,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAB30nUoBUvPfDvlZUxXvcgIasRAMJZAgL9U,name",500,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAB30nUoBUvPfDvlZUxXvcgIasRAMJZAgL9U%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAB30nUoBUvPfDvlZUxXvcgIasRAMJZAgL9U%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,,University of KwaZulu-Natal,https://www.linkedin.com/company/university-of-kwazulu-natal/,Laboratory Assistant,"Pietermaritzburg Area, South Africa",feb. de 2018 – actualidad,,,,,,,University of KwaZulu-Natal,https://www.linkedin.com/school/19878/?legacySchoolId=19878,Master of Science - MS,,Animal Genetics,2019 – 2020,University of KwaZulu-Natal,https://www.linkedin.com/school/19878/?legacySchoolId=19878,BSc Hons Genetics,RESEARCH TOPIC :   Effect of Selection and Production Systems on the Genomic  Structure of Sheep breeds,Life Sciences,2018 – 2018,,3 de enero,http://www.ukzn.ac.za/,"Genetics, DNA Extraction, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Gel Electrophoresis, Laboratory Skills, Bioinformatics, Microbiology, Research, Molecular Biology, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, Statiscal Data analysis, Stem Cell Technology, Fuel Cells",Genetics,5,DNA Extraction,4,Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR),4,Gel Electrophoresis,1,Laboratory Skills,1,Bioinformatics,1,https://www.linkedin.com/in/khanyi-tenza-376387120,khanyi-tenza-376387120,2020-04-20T02:02:29.373Z,,,,,,,

I was involved in setting up a new office and its financial process and, improved the cash flow of business by approximately 5-10% through cost-cutting initiatives, by expanding my role and taking on additional responsibilities. This enables the company to disengage the external consultant in the area of finance and accounting.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/cat-downing-schwartz/,,"In a world where the demands of innovation and staying ahead of competition are at their fiercest, my project management approach brings everything back to the basics—the people. 

I’m particularly obsessed with rallying the troops, building consensus, and securing buy-in from stakeholders across the board (and around the world). 

In fact, it’s this empowering and collaborative leadership style that has opened doors for me throughout my 15+ year career. It’s why I’m often sought out as the ""go-to"" person to steer business critical, high-change projects: I know how to break down barriers and partner with my teams to create real results.

A commitment to service, engagement, and growth doesn’t hurt either!

With a diverse background driving healthcare, technology, and telecommunications projects, I’m unwaveringly consistent in bringing value to the table. I’m also known for infusing a culture of “can do” into every team and for my tenacious approach to even the toughest problems.  

If you love talking about ways to inspire teams or unleash the power of people, we should chat. Feel free to connect with me here or email me directly at catdowning@cox.net.

A few of my specialties include:
 
● Agile Project Management
● Change Management & Process / Performance Optimization
● Cross-Functional, Remote/ Virtual and Geographically-Diverse Team Leadership
● eCommerce, Systems Analysis, Integration & Implementation
● Healthcare + Health Systems 
● JIRA/ Confluence Expert

https://www.linkedin.com/in/andyrmcleod/,,"After earning two post-secondary degrees in history, I switched gears and followed my interests into the film industry. I started as a production assistant in the mid-90s before quickly moving through the production ranks and becoming a producer in 1998.

In 2005, I met Shin Sugino and added executive producing and sales to my skill set. In October 2015, Radke Films bought Sugino Studio. Tony DiMarco and I were brought in to be managing partners of the company that would take its place. We re-branded as Free Society. After a career in production, I am now focused primarily on business development at Free Society.

I believe that a willingness to learn is essential to success and fulfillment in my personal and professional life. This never-ending apprenticeship mentality is particularly important in a constantly changing industry like advertising.

I am always seeking information and discussing new technologies, business models and processes. Some of this learning has been more formal. In 2012, I earned my Project Management Professional designation. In 2017, I enrolled in the Leadership Essentials program with the University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies. I have completed courses on ""Managing People"" and ""Critical Thinking"".

There I  was engaged in exploring mitochondrial genetics involved in metabolic diseases that is the first project of this kind in Pakistan. I have successfully completed that project. Now I am working as Associate Professor in the Rashid Latif Medical College (RLMC). Here I am working on the pathology of cancer that is the ultimate motive of the present world as diseases predominantly end up with the progression of Cancer. During my stay in RLMC Lahore I went through many body mechanisms but my mind just leaped down to cancer biology, how the normal signaling of cell gets off the track and causes the abnormal functioning of cell. That really matters acknowledging us that this abnormality does not limit to a single cell but is as well induced in the circumferential cells and multiple organs

Prostate cancer biology is an extensive branch of cancer biology. To be more specified for my research on Prostate cancer I chose Fusion transcripts and the involvement of their oncoproteins in genomic instability and rearrangements. As the problem arose priory due to fusion transcripts in the hematological malignancies and now reached up to the epithelial cells of prostate cancer. Moreover, I focused on the TGF signaling. The TGF signaling plays an essential role in the activation of the proteins like ATM which are engaged in the faithful repair of DNA. I followed the interaction and involvement of Smurf and NEDD4 proteins in TGF signaling, kicking upstairs the cancer progression via ubiquitylation of SMAD protein, which ends up with the instability of genomic material.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-gryta-431b962/,,"I started my career with the commodities group at JP Morgan in 1994. I learned about the economics of the energy business from upstream exploration to downstream refining. I witnessed daily the workings of the futures market and how the spot price and front month contract could affect the entire commodity futures price curve. I was lucky to sit with some very talented marketers who would consistently assure clients and calm their fears of liquidity and price action.

I spent 11 years trading equities either for myself or small proprietary firm where discipline and perfecting risk/reward calculations is essential for survival. Every year I was profitable and averaged Net profitability 10 months out of the year.

In 2008 I went to trade for Koyote Capital ( Schotenfeld Group ) where I was allowed to immerse myself with Equities and Futures trading. I sharpened my global macro trading methods while being able to capitalize on various types of events using the global futures markets and its 24 hour access.

Until July of 2016 I managed a stock equity portfolio with the head of the family from Einbender management. I excelled at hedging the general portfolio and individual securities for events such as an earnings announcement.  I was involved with evaluating all private equity investments while understanding the liquidity needs of the family. I spent time constructing financial statements for the family and then modeling them to understand future cash flow opportunities. 

In June of 2017 I made a career pivot and started to work as a subcontractor for the Disputes and Investigations division of Alvarez and Marsal. I use my capital markets experience to help the team assist clients who received a compliance inquiry or notice of investigation by a government or membership ruling body. I work with large sets of data to help form the quantifiable portion of a client defense answer that supports the total explanation to the inquiry.","Nueva York y alrededores, Estados Unidos",https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQFc8iYZqkJgig/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1593043200&v=beta&t=X6NRHu-w0peZKM7BOCBSXNGd0iUnhDdiBEhDVo1GeDE,Jay,Gryta,Jay Gryta,1002,3rd,ACoAAACH5-UBFmQeKY1vfWoPk9orqBqLpPHKSuo,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAACH5-UBFmQeKY1vfWoPk9orqBqLpPHKSuo,name",500,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAACH5-UBFmQeKY1vfWoPk9orqBqLpPHKSuo%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAACH5-UBFmQeKY1vfWoPk9orqBqLpPHKSuo%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,,Koyote Capital,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Koyote%20Capital,Senior Trader,"New York, New York",nov. de 2018 – actualidad,Alvarez & Marsal,https://www.linkedin.com/company/alvarez-&-marsal/,Subcontractor,"Investigative consulting on Capital Markets regulatory issues.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/nazaninazari/,,"My motivation is to help individuals and companies innovate localized global initiatives with practical business analysis and international project management to deliver perfectly & competitively localized products.
I inject life (language, culture, and local functionality) into global marketing, SEO, e-learning, video, gaming, AI, web, and software products. I am very interested in the impact of AI and the influence of technology on the future of the language industry. 

I am a Project and Technical Account Manager for Translation and Localization Services. Currently, my full-time employment is with MCIS Language Solutions, a multilingual LSP based in Canada. Five years ago I started my cub years in the language industry at MCIS's Training Department. As the Training and Testing Coordinator, I helped with instructional design, testing and mentorship initiatives for a year. Then, I danced my way to the Interpretation Service Department. After a few months of joining the team, I became the lead project manager for all the language needs of The Ottawa Hospital. At the same time, I also put on the hat of the After-hours Technical Support Coordinator for urgent requests by law enforcement, shelters, and medical centers. After about nine months of fully developing the process for the language needs of The Ottawa Hospital, I handed the project to the operation's team. I then danced my way to the Sales & Marketing Department to assist with the business & technical initiatives, as the lead AM for T9n & L10n projects. 

 Since 2017, I have been gaining experience and studying the field of T9n, L10n, and Digital Marketing. I am presently a certification candidate with the UofWashington for Localization/Globalization (Software and Web). Concurrently, in March 2020,  I obtained my certification with the UofToronto in Data Analytics (Statistics, Programming, Business Intelligence Software, Data Visualization, Front End Web Visualization, Machine Learning and Big Data).

Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 

I am currently working to discover paralog-specific functions of the Small Ubiquitin-related Modifiers (SUMO1 and SUMO2) in human cancer cells. Specifically, I am using quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy, RNA-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, qRT-PCR and western blot assays to analyze interesting phenotypes in CRISPR knock out cell lines. This work could ultimately aid in the design of more targeted therapies for SUMO-regulated functions that are involved in cancer and neurodegenerative disease onset and/or progression. 

In 2019, I published my work evaluating a SUMO protease (SENP1) as a potential pancreatic cancer biomarker in a peer-reviewed open-access journal (see summary section for PDF, or below for link).

Genome-scale metabolic models (GeMMs) enable hierarchical integration of disparate data types into a framework amenable to computational simulations enabling deeper mechanistic insights from high-throughput data measurements. Through my PhD, I used GeMMs of multiple Plasmodium species  to study metabolic similarities and differences across the Plasmodium genus. In silico gene-knock out simulations across species and stages uncovered functional metabolic differences between human- and rodent-infecting species as well as across the parasite’s life-cycle stages. These findings may help identify drug regimens that are more effective in targeting human-infecting species across multiple stages of the organism.","Bioinformatics, Computational Biology",2013 – 2018,,,,,,,,18 de abril,http://www.ucalgary.ca/,"Bioinformatics, Modeling, Computational Biology, Pharmacology, Assay Development, Cancer, Laboratory, Scientific Writing, bioinformatics, Simulations, Data Analysis, Data Integration, Data integration, Oncology, Genomics, Mathematical Modeling, Matlab, R, Linux, Adobe Illustrator, Unix, Relational Databases, SQL, Python, Teaching, Cancer Research, COBRA, Molecular Pharmacology, Constraint-based Modelling, Science Communication, Systems Biology, metabolic modeling, NGS, Data Analytics, Data Wrangling, Statistical inference, Cancer Biology, Predictive Modeling, Bioconductor, Single Cell Sequencing, Stochiometric models, Network analysis, scikit-learn, ggplot, Jupyter Notebook",Bioinformatics,38,Modeling,6,Computational Biology,11,Pharmacology,13,Assay Development,4,Cancer,3,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyamahmoud,alyamahmoud,2020-04-27T14:00:08.000Z,"- Develop and test data-driven hypotheses to identify novel brain tumour biomarkers for adults and paediatric patients using single-cell transcriptomics data.

Just as melody, tone, harmony, and rhythm support the music... variability, variety, velocity and veracity in data are foundations of performing analysis and providing insights. 

Deriving analysis & analytics to predict and support decision making that drive where insights can take stakeholders in their experiences are keys to success.

As a data driven analyst I'm equally passionate about understanding data, exploring, relationships, patterns, variations, combinations and permutations.

I am crave for solving business problems through data logic. I once participated in  National Business Case Competition called ATCC and proposed the concept of combining financial technology and skills exchange to break into Cathay Financial ’s top 19. 

I also used to advance to second round of Cathay Life Big Data Competition , which is to build a model to predict one's probability of purchasing critical illness insurance, and result in top 40% out of 600 participants. 

Recently, I participated in the Taiwanese Microsoft x TSMC's hackathon competition. In the group of  computer vision defect detection, our group overcame the shortcomings of traditional computer vision , and combined with the concept of deep learning to improve the model.Lastly, we won the second place in the group.

In addition to statistics, data analysis, and database operation capabilities, I also adept in applying Machine Learning to real-world problems. I worked as a research assistant in a cooperation project between the professor of economics at the National Taiwan University and the Ministry of Finance, using Python to clean up billions of electronic ticket transaction data and successfully construct a model that can predict which industry each ticket belongs to.  The accuracy of the test set reached 92%.

Each case study deals with a particular application of the main methodology and consists of a number of fixed subtasks, i.e. theoretical framework, data gathering and processing, methodological developments, application and interpretation of the results.",,,,,,Transportation researcher| Road Safety Expert| Structural Design Engineer (Seeking new opportunities)
https://www.linkedin.com/in/mytrapham/,,"I am a double major in Business Analytics and Accounting focusing on Internal Audit and Data Science at UT Dallas with strong curiosity about the practical use of data analytics in auditing and risk management. I obtained my undergraduate degree in May 2018 from Augustana College in Accounting and Business Administration with a concentration in Finance and a minor in Economics. 

After one year of working as Accounts Payable Assistant at Augustana College, I excelled in using software programs to process high volumes of invoices efficiently and ensured timely payments to vendors. During this time, I constantly used the aging schedule and negotiated with vendors to collect their payments. From these experiences, I developed communication and time management skills. I also completed an audit project at Trinity Lutheran Church, Illinois. Here I reviewed the client’s financial statements and other business documents to assess the internal controls of the church and provided recommendations to improve their system security and website. This project not only helped me demonstrate my detail-oriented and analytical mindset as well as problem solving skills, but also provoked my interest in becoming a consultant.

After studying abroad in East Asia and Italy, I came to realize that I love working in an international company where diversity plays a crucial role in the culture of the organization. Having passed the CMA, I hope to pursue the CIA, CISA by Fall 2019 and the CPA by 2020, and I aspire to use the power of data analytics to solve business problems as a Risk Advisory consultant.","Dallas, Texas",https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQG3s8_m7llgiQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1593648000&v=beta&t=9w6cUTSXGkHkapuh7eoKzZP0PN4aeB80kJ3XZD-LMTk,My Tra,"Pham, CMA","My Tra Pham, CMA",1512,2nd,ACoAACaWErIBlF7Dm0TrAxgJkDHW_7CvbWf1qC8,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAACaWErIBlF7Dm0TrAxgJkDHW_7CvbWf1qC8,name",500,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAACaWErIBlF7Dm0TrAxgJkDHW_7CvbWf1qC8%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAACaWErIBlF7Dm0TrAxgJkDHW_7CvbWf1qC8%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,1,ALM First,https://www.linkedin.com/company/alm-first/,Data Analyst Intern,Dallas/Fort Worth Area,ago. de 2019 – dic. de 2019,Charles Schwab,https://www.linkedin.com/company/charles-schwab/,Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and Internal Controls over Compliance (ICOC) - Financial Reporting Intern,"•	Partnered with seven Business Process and IT testing specialists to host walkthrough meetings, perform audit tests utilizing Alteryx and PeopleSoft to issue testing results for management

I am working on my thesis on the impact of exercise on depressive symptoms yet something else piqued my interest. I started enjoying the work as a research and teaching assistant that involved managing students, improving student morale, and maximizing efficiency in the day-to-day procedures.

Although I have changed focus, learning and making an impact continues to be my drive.
